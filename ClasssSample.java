/*An object is created from a class.
1. An object in Java is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming 
and represents real-life entities.
2. Objects are the instances of a class that are created to use the 
attributes and methods of a class.
3. A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, 
interact by invoking methods. An object consists of : 

State: It is represented by attributes of an object. 
It also reflects the properties of an object.

Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. 
It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.

give meaningful names to class variable and methods*/
